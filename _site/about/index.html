    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Here's a little bit about me!</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
      I'm currently attending Western Governor's University for my Bachelor of
      Science in Computer Science. I plan on graduating in December 2024!
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>
      I began coding over ten years ago, when I was playing Minecraft and wanted
      to recreate a plugin from my favorite server. Minecraft uses Java, so it
      was the first language I learned, and I quickly became addicted to coding.
      I've since expanded my knowledge and now I'm familiar with
      <em>Java, C#, C++, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS</em>.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Beyond the Computer</h2>
    <p>
      Other than Computer Science, I'm always intrested in learning things. For
      exercise, I love to hike and kayak. Woodworking is also a hobby of mine.
      You can see some of my projects on my Posts page. Additionally, I've
      always been interested in physics and engineering and I like to do home
      projects in those subjects every once in a while.
