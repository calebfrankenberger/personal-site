    <p>
      Welcome to my site! It's pretty great, isn't it? I'm still working on it, but have a
      look around at what I've got so far.

    <h2>Who are you?</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Caleb Frankenberger. I'm a CS student as WGU. Check out my
      About Me page if you're interested in reading more.

    <h2>Website tech?</h2>
    <p>
      This site is powered by <em>11ty</em>, <em>NetlifyCMS</em>, and good old
      JavaScript/HTML/CSS. 11ty generates static webpages for me, making for an
      extremely fast website. NetlifyCMS allows me to add posts to the site
      without having to even touch source code.
    </p>

    <h2>What is this section?</h2>
    <p>
      This section is filler text because I don't know what else to put on this
      page. Maybe I'll change it, eventually..
